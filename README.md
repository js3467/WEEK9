Which Honeypot(s) you deployed

I deployed mhn-honeypot-1-dionaea

Any issues you encountered

I encountered a few issues in my MHN admin vm. I was unable to fix it so i deleated it and then re-built it and it worked.

A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.

I had 1079 attacked. Most of them casued by my nmap scan but then i quickly started reciving new attackes from other sources. No malware detected.

Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected. 

No
